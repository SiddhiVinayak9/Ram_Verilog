# Ram_Verilog
Design and Verification of RAM using Verilog
                                      **SPECIFICATIONS**
RAM is 32 bit in size.
1 clk signal,1 reset,1 read enable, 1 write enable, 1 data in[8bits] , 1 data out[8bits], 1 address[5bits].
I had to upload the screenshots of the project as i lost access to  the server.
                                        **TESTPLAN**
Testcase1- Write to all locations Then Read from all locations
Testcase2- Write to 0th location then read from 0th location. Similarly go from 0th to 31st location.
Testcase3- First write and then read to a random location.
Testcase4- Write to random aand read from locations.
Testcase5- Write and Read at the same time.
